                            <a class="txt-colorChange" href="https://www.aueb.gr" target="aueb">AUEB</a>.
                            Computer Science was not always a likeable course of mine but i took an interest in it when i was 17.

                            I work as a waiter once a week at Thrakomakedones. 
                            The working environment is not good but due time i got used to it. 
                            I mostly stay there because the pay is good and to get working experience.
